    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
    <p>My name is Brittney Jackson. I was born and raised in Connecticut. 
     I like to draw. Normally, I draw digitally on my iPad. I have been 
     doing that for about 2 years now. I've always loved to draw, I just didn't
     take the time to perfect my skills over the years. I still draw with pencil and paper
     from time to time but prefer to draw digitally because it's so much more versatile.
      DIY projects are how I relax. It's enjoyable to take something and make
     it into something completely different.
