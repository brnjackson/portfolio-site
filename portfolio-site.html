                    <p>
                    My name is <yellow>Brittney Jackson</yellow>. I was born and raised in Connecticut. 
                    I like to draw. Normally, I draw digitally on my iPad. I have been 
                    doing that for about 2 years now. I've always loved to draw, I just didn't
                    take the time to <orange>perfect my skills</orange> over the years. I still draw with pencil and paper
                    from time to time but prefer to <<red>draw digitally</red>> because it's so much more versatile.
                    DIY projects are how I relax. It's enjoyable to take something and make
                    it into something completely different.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe it or not, I devoloped my <purple>love of computers</purple> by just being on MySpace. I would
                    spend most of my nights and weekends when I wasn't in school editing code for layouts. It
                    was fun to see how some words and puncuation could change the whole look of a website. After that
                    I started getting into <green>photo editing and typography</green>. I enjoyed this so much, that I decided to
                    major in Graphic Design in college.
