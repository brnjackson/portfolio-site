    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
    <p>My name is Brittney Jackson. I was born and raised in Connecticut. 
     I like to draw. Normally, I draw digitally on my iPad. I have been 
     doing that for about 2 years now. I've always loved to draw, I just didn't
     take the time to perfect my skills over the years. I still draw with pencil and paper
     from time to time but prefer to draw digitally because it's so much more versatile.
    DIY projects are how I relax. It's enjoyable to take something and make
     it into something completely different. 

     Believe it or not, I devoloped my love of computers by just being on MySpace. I would
     spend most of my nights and weekends when I wasn't in school editing code for layouts. It
     was fun to see how some words and puncuation could change the whole look of a website. After that
     I started getting into photo editing and typography. I enjoyed this so much, that I decided to
     major in Graphic Design in college.
