•	Identify the component of this assignment that you did the
best on, and why. 
o	Creating the basic skeleton for HTML. I already have some experience, I took a Web Design class in 2013 to complete my college degree and had some of this information stored in the back of my head.
•	Describe in plain English what problem this assignment was
posing, and what your solution was to it. 
o	To create a custom online portfolio site and to present all of the changes that were made to the code. My solution was to create the skeleton of the code first, then after all the information was presented, I added color elements and shapes. I did my code in sections and after each section I would commit my changes and push them to GitHub.
•	What was your approach or process?
o	My approach was to work on the parts that I was most familiar with at first – which was HTML and CSS – and then work on committing changes to GitHub which I had been having a hard time with originally. 
•	What were your challenges? 
o	My challenge was making sure all the steps were completed in the right order.  I would forget one step which would cause all of my code to be off so I would need to go back and edit it.
•	What resources did you use?   
o	I went through the class slides multiple times, familiarizing myself with the commands as well as HTML and CSS. There were some things I googled, I found information on Free Coding Camp and some other websites.
